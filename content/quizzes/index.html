Welcome to our quizzes page

<p>Use the navigation bar on the left side to select a quiz and test your knowledge of Unix!</p>
<p>We recommend these either as a quick refresher/affirmation if you're coming back to Unix or to be used concurrently with our tutorials to reinforce what you're learning!</p>
<p>They are organized by tutorial, but we have a quiz that takes a random selection of questions from all available! So try that one out if you want a real challenge of your Unix knowledge.</p>
