<h2>Lesson 1: File and directory manipulation </h2>
<h3>ls (List) </h3>
<p> When you first login, your landing directory is your home directory.
  Your home directory is in the home system folder and has the same name as your user-name, for example, <strong>/home/chad/</strong>,
  and it is where your personal files reside. </p>
<p> To find out what's in your home folder, type </p>
<p class="code">% ls </p>
<p>The <strong>ls</strong> command <strong>( lowercase L and lowercase S )</strong> lists the contents of your current working directory.</p>

<p>There may be no files visible in your home directory, in which case, nothing will show up! Or maybe some system default files will exist.</p>
<p><strong>ls</strong> only lists visible files by default. Files
  beginning with a dot (.) are known as hidden files and usually contain important
  program configurations. They are hidden because they require a higher level of UNIX to work with/edit correctly! </p>
<p> To list <emphasis>all</emphasis> files in your home directory including those who are hidden, type </p>
<p class="code">% ls -a</p>
<p>As you can see, <strong>ls -a</strong> lists files that are normally hidden. </p>
<p align="center"><img width="679" height="429" alt="Results of ls command with -a flag" src="../../static/images/tutorial1/tutorial1picture2.png"> </p>
<p>The -a is an example of an extra option or flag that the command takes into consideration when running.
  The options change the behaviour of the command. If you want to know more about a command you can use <strong>man {command}</strong> </p>

 <h3>pwd (Print Working Directory)</h3>
 <p>There are instances where you may want to know where in your folder structure you are as there is no GUI on the terminal. <strong>pwd</strong> is a command designed to help with this.</p>
 <p>When you enter the command</p>
<p class="code">% pwd</p>
<p> A line is printed showing where you are in the file system you are starting from the <strong>root</strong> or <emphasis>base folder</emphasis>.</p>
 <p align="center"><img width="676" height="424" alt="Results of pwd command" src="../../static/images/tutorial1/tutorial1picture3.png"> </p>
 <p>As you can see from the picture above, I am in the /home/chad folder... My home directory! One of the most important things of Unix is knowing where you are at all times!</p>
 
  <h3>cd (Change Directory)</h3>
 <p>The command 'cd <emphasis>directory</emphasis>' means change the current working directory to 'directory'. The current working directory may be thought of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the file-system tree.</p>
 <p>When you enter the command</p>
<p class="code">% cd test</p>
<p>Unix will look in your current working directory for a folder named test and switch to it if found.</p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that all directory names will be relative to the current directory unless you enter a special symbol. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The current directory character, represented by a period. (.)</li>
	<li>The parent directory symbol, represented by two periods. (..)</li>
	<li>The root directory symbol, represented by a forward slash. (/)</li>
	<li>The home directory symbol, represented by a tilde. (~)</li>
</ul>
 <p align="center"><img width="1054" height="500" alt="Results of cd command" src="../../static/images/tutorial1/tutorial1picture4.png"> </p>
 <p>As you can see from the picture above, I am in my home directory and then I switch to the test folder using the 'cd test' command. I also could have achieved this using 'cd ./test' as '.' means current directory so I am telling Unix to search in my current directory for a folder named test.</p>
 
 <h3>touch</h3>
 <p>The command 'touch <emphasis>filename</emphasis> has two uses. Firstly, if you specify a filename that doesn't exist it will create a new empty file with that name. Secondly, if there is a file with that name then it will update it's last accessed and last modified times to when you entered the touch command.</p>
 <p>When you enter the command</p>
<p class="code">% touch test</p>
<p>Unix will create in your current working directory a file named test.</p>
 <p align="center"><img width="1054" height="500" alt="Results of touch command" src="../../static/images/tutorial1/tutorial1picture5.png"> </p>
 <p>As you can see from the picture above, I check to see what files I have in my test folder and none show up. Then create a file named test using the <emphasis>touch</emphasis> command and upon checking for files again using <emphasis>ls</emphasis> the newly created test file shows up.</p>
