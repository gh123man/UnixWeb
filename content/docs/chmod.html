<p>Category: File Permissions <br/>
Definition: used to control access/permissions to files and directories. There are set
"rules" in every hierachy that define who can access what file. These rules are known as 
file permissions that looks to read (r), write (w), and execute (x) the file. The abilities are set to define
the permissions for three different groups: the user (aka the owner), the group (list of users belonging to the ownership's group), and
the public (Other).

<br/><br/>
<u>Quick and dirty reference</u>: you can determine these permissions by implementing u=rw, go=rx, 755, or 644. If you don't 
understand these numbers or letter combinations, refer to explanations below.
</p>

<p><u>How to use permissions:</u><br/><br/>
There are two ways that you can set permissions, by a combination of letter/operators or by a set of three numbers.
The first way is by letters/operators:
To define the different groups, you must a user class symbol:
  <ul class="task-list">
    <li> u : user/owner </li>
    <li> g : group</li>
    <li> o : other/public </li>
    <li> a : all which is the same as ugo</li>
  </ul>
To determine how to set, take away, or add symbols, you must use a permission operator:
  <ul class="task-list">
    <li> = : allows the specified permissions to be enabled for defined user class</li>
    <li> + : adds/allows the specified permissions to be enabled for defined user class</li>
    <li> - : takes away/prohibits the specified permissions to be enabled for defined user class </li>
  </ul>
And lastly, you must determine the permissions themselves. 
  <ul class="task-list">
    <li> r : the ability to read the contents of the file</li>
    <li> w : the ability to change the contents of the file (write)</li>
    <li> x : the ability to run the contents of the file as a program </li>
  </ul>

Examples of class/operator/permissions combinations:
<ul>
  <li>u=rwx
    <ul>
      <li>user/owner can read, write, and execute the file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>o+r
    <ul>
      <li>other/public can other read the file as well</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>u-w
    <ul>
      <li>user/owner can no longer change the contents of the file (write)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>u-w
    <ul>
      <li>user/owner can no longer change the contents of the file (write)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<br/><br/>
The second way is by three numbers. Each number represents a permission type.
 <ul class="task-list">
    <li> 4: read</li>
    <li> 2: write</li>
    <li> 1 : execute </li>
    <li> 0 : no permission</li>
  </ul>
To set permissions for each user class, we use a three digit number to represent them all. for example 654. 6 refers
to the owner/user class, 5 to the group class, and 4 to the other/public class. How did we get 6 & 5? Simple really, 
to represent multiple permissions to each other.
<br/><br/>
So for the user class we have 6 which means we combined the read(4) and the execute(2) permissions together (4+2 = 6).
<br/><br/>
For the group, it was the read(4) and execute(1) permissions to get 5.
<br/><br/>
The other/public class, it's easy, we simply have 4 for read.
<br/><br/>
Common combinations are: 644 for files and 755 for directories.

	<tr>
		<th>Options</th>
		<th>Explanation</th>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-C, --changes</td>
		<td>reports when a change is made</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-f, --silent, --quiet</td>
		<td>makes it so error messages are not shown</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-v, --verbose</td>
		<td>prints out details/diagnostic for every file processed/changed</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-h, --no-dereference</td>
		<td>affects symbolic links instead of any referenced file <br/> can only use this if you can change symlink ownership</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>--no-preserve-root</td>
		<td>do not treat '/' in a special way <br/> this is the default setting</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>--reference=FILENAME</td>
		<td>use FILENAME's group settings rather than specifying a group value</td>
	<tr>
		<td>-R, --recursive</td>
		<td>operates recursively on files and directories<br/>
        these options modify how hierarchy is affected when -R is specified:
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; -H: traverses a symlink if it's on the cmd line
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; -L: traverses every symbolic link to a directory
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; -P: do not traverse any symbolic links (default)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>--help</td>
		<td>cdisplay help message and exits</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>--version</td>
		<td>displays version and exits</td>
	</tr>

<p>Examples:</p>
	<pre>chmod 644 file.txt</pre>
	<pre>chmod u=rx file.txt</pre>
	<pre>chmod a=rw file.txt</pre>
	
	<br/><br/>
	<p>Also note that when you type "ls - l" in your command line to see all directories/files, permissions will be displayed first.
