Content here is with html not markup. I can change this.

For content organization purposes, some javascript and css has been added in the file. I will put them in their respective 
files when all content is written and organization is approved/standarized for the project. It is temporary.

Example and test pages have been moved to archive folder.
Content will be organized into folders for now to keep track of everything.
Folders and their contents (based on navigation structure):
  + Homepage
    + index.html
    
  + UNIX Tutorials
  
  + UNIX Quizzes
  
  + UNIX and Beyond
    + History of UNIX
    
    + UNIX Applications
    
    + OS based UNIX
  
  + Command Reference
