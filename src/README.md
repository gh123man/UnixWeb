Source
======

This is core PHP source code. Everything must be in a class based structure other than miscellaneous helper methods that should be named as such. 

####Notes
 - no binary files (images/media)
 - no HTML files (should be PHP only)
 - no HTML embedded in PHP - this code should be modular and front end independent.
