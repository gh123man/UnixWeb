Team Project Readme!
====================
Here you will find all you need to know about the site structure. Look for these docs in each folder of the site.

FYI: the format of this file is markdown: [Info here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)

A nice markdown editor can be found [here](http://dillinger.io/)


The root folder
---------------

This is the site root. It contains important files for routing and our whole file structure.

####Some notes
 - do not delete your .git folder, its contents are gits meta data
 - never put html in the 'src' folder. that is for framework code.
 - only static data goes in 'static' (images, javascript, css)
 - only flat file content and minimal HTML goes in the 'content' folder
